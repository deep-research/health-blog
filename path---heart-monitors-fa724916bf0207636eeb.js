Most importantly, it records your Continuous Heart Rate directly from your wrist instead of just using the pulse rate.</li>\n<li><a href="https://support.polar.com/us-en/support/difference-between-heart-rate-and-pulse">Click here</a> to see an article on the difference between pulse and heart rate.</li>\n<li>Tracking Continuous Heart Rate can help people with diminished heart function avoid triggers such as high heat. The data can be studied to determine what your triggers are. These triggers can increase a person’s heart rate to dangerous levels.</li>\n<li>The heart rate data can also help to determine when overexertion is reached during exercise. The Fitbit mobile app for iPhone shows you your Resting Heart Rate. It provides the user with information on which heart rate zones have occured during the day. The catagories include Fat Burn, Cardio and Peak. It is best to avoid the Cario and Peak zones if you have a weak heart.</li>\n<li>The Resting Heart Rate data generates graphs that show the change over time. You can view the changes over a daily, monthly or even yearly time frame. This helps track the progress of your fitness and dietary routines.</li>\n<li>If the device shows that you have a high heart rate, you can use it as an early warning signal to make an appointment with a cardialogist or go to an emergency room. Taking action at the right time can save your life.</li>\n<li>The Fitbit device is also very useful for monitoring your prescription drug use. You can see the effect that a drug is having on your heart rate. This monitoring is available 24/7.
